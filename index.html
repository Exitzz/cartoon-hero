<h2>Who is Courage?</h2>
<p>Courage is a kind yet easily frightened pink dog.
He was abandoned as a puppy after his parents were forcibly sent into outer space by a crazed veterinarian.
Soon after, he was found in an alleyway by Muriel Bagge, a friendly, sweet-natured Scottish woman.
He lives with elderly Muriel and her also elderly husband Eustace Bagge ,
a grumpy, selfish and greedy farmer who regularly mistreats Courage out of jealousy and refers to him as "stupid dog".
The entire family lives in a small, isolated farmhouse in what consists of a large, desert-like area in the middle of Kansas:
the nearest town to the farmhouse is a fictional town with the literal name of Nowhere.</p>
